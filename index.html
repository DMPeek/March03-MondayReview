    <h1>What I learned last week:</h1>
    <p>First, I got a much better understanding of how for loops work. It took me a bit to understand the <br>
    syntax for setting then up, but now I feel pretty comfortable with my understanding.</p>
    <p>Second, I got a better understanding of setting up and calling variables, and whether or not said <br>
    variables need to be placed within or outside of functions/for loops</p>
    <p>Third, I learned more about arrays and how to shuffle the placements of the items within the array <br>
    through a personal project I worked on.</p> <br>
    <h3>Things I still need to work on:</h3>
    <h6>(click the blue word for a lil alert)</h6>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="button" id="button1">CSS Styling</span>, I am still very weak when it comes to understanding how to influence properties of an element</li>
        <li><span class="button" id="button2">Efficiency</span>, sometimes I will come to a conclusion for a problem in more complex ways than is needed.</li>
        <li><span class="button" id="button3">Memory</span>, I need to get better at remembering different syntaxes from memory. I know what I need, but I forget syntaxes.</li>
    </ul>
